## Development

### Building

To build pack:

make build
```

This will output the binary to the directory `out/`.

Options:

| ENV_VAR      | Description                                                            | Default |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| GOCMD        | Change the `go` executable. For example, [richgo][rgo] for testing.    | go      |
| PACK_BIN     | Change the name or location of the binary relative to `out/`.          | pack    |
| PACK_VERSION | Tell `pack` what version to consider itself                            | `dev`   |

## Pull Requests

1. **[Fork]((https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)) the repo**    
2. **Code, Test, Commit...**
    
    _Don't forget utilize the convenient make functions above._

3. **Preparing a Branch**

    We prefer to have PRs that are encompassed in a single commit. This might
    require that you execute some of these commands:
    
    If you are no up-to-date with master:
    ```bash
    # rebase from master (applies your changes on top of master)
    git pull -r origin master
    ```
    
    If you made more than one commit:
    ```bash
    # squash multiple commits, if applicable
    # set the top most commit to `pick` and all subsequent to `squash`
    git rebase -i origin/master
    ```
    
    Another requirement is that you sign your work. See [DCO](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) for more details.
    ```bash
    git commit --amend --signoff
    ```
    
4. **Submit a Pull Request**
    
    Submitting the pull request is done in [GitHub](https://github.com/buildpack/pack/compare/) by selecting
    your branch as the `compare` branch.
