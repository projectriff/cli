The ` + c.Name + ` CLI combines with the projectriff system CRDs to build, run and wire
workloads (functions, applications and containers). The CRDs provide the riff
API of which this CLI is a client.

Before running ` + c.Name + `, please install the projectriff system and its dependencies.
See https://projectriff.io/docs/getting-started/

The application, function and container commands define build plans and the
credential commands to authenticate builds to container registries.

Runtimes provide ways to execute the workloads. Different runtimes provide
alternate execution models and capabilities.
