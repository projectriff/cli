Handlers can be created for one of an application, function or image.
Application and function based handlers continuously watch for the latest built
image and will deploy new images. If the underlying application or function is
deleted, the handler will continue to run, but will no longer self update. Image
based handlers must be manually updated to trigger roll out of an updated image.

Applications, functions and images are logically equivalent at runtime.
Functions with an invoker are more focused and opinionated applications, and
images are compiled applications.

Users wishing to perform checks on built images before deploying them can
provide their own external process to watch the application/function for new
images and only update the handler image once those checks pass.

The hostname to access the handler is available in the handler listing.
