Deployers can be created for a build reference or image. Build based deployers
continuously watch for the latest built image and will deploy new images. If the
underlying build resource is deleted, the deployer will continue to run, but
will no longer self update. Image based deployers must be manually updated to
trigger the rollout of an updated image.

Users wishing to perform checks on built images before deploying them can
provide their own external process to watch the build resource for new images
and only update the deployer image once those checks pass.

The hostname to access the deployer is available in the deployer listing.
