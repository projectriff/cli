## riff knative adapter

adapters push built images to Knative

### Synopsis

The Knative runtime adapter updates a Knative Service or Configuration with the
latest image from a riff build. As the build produces new images, they will be
rolled out automatically to the target Knative resource.

No new Knative resources are created directly by the adapter, it only updates
the image for an existing resource.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for adapter
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config file        config file (default is $HOME/.riff.yaml)
      --kube-config file   kubectl config file (default is $HOME/.kube/config)
      --no-color           disable color output in terminals
```
