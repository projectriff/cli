## riff

riff is for functions

### Synopsis

The riff CLI combines with the projectriff system CRDs to build, run and wire
workloads (functions, applications and containers). The CRDs provide the riff
API of which this CLI is a client.

Before running riff, please install the projectriff system and its dependencies.
See https://projectriff.io/docs/getting-started/

The application, function and container commands define build plans and the
credential commands to authenticate builds to container registries.

Runtimes provide ways to execute the workloads. Different runtimes provide
alternate execution models and capabilities.

The core runtime uses core Kubernetes resources like Deployment and Service to
expose the workload over HTTP.

The streaming runtime maps one or more input and output streams to a function.

The Knative runtime uses Knative Serving to expose the workload over HTTP with
zero-to-n autoscaling and managed ingress.

### Options

      --config file       config file (default is $HOME/.riff.yaml)
