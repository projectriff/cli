## riff application

applications built from source using application buildpacks

### Synopsis

Applications are a mechanism to convert web application source code into
container images that can be invoked over HTTP. Cloud Native Buildpacks are
provided to detect the language, provide a language runtime, install build and
runtime dependencies, compile the application, and packaging everything as a
container.

The application resource is only responsible for converting source code into a
container. The application container image may then be deployed on the core or
knative runtime.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for application
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

      --kube-config file   kubectl config file (default is $HOME/.kube/config)

```
