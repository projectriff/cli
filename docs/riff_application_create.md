## riff application create

create an application from source

### Synopsis

Create an application from source using the application Cloud Native Buildpack
builder.

Application source can be specified either as a Git repository or as a local
directory. Builds from Git are run in the cluster while builds from a local
directory are run inside a local Docker daemon and are orchestrated by this
command (in the future, builds from local source may also be run in the
cluster).

```
riff application create <name> [flags]
```

### Examples

```
riff application create my-app --image registry.example.com/image --git-repo https://example.com/my-app.git
riff application create my-app --image registry.example.com/image --local-path ./my-app
```
