## riff streaming stream delete

delete stream(s)

### Synopsis

Delete one or more streams by name or all streams within a namespace.

Deleting a stream will prevent processors from reading and writing messages on
the stream. Existing messages in the stream may be preserved by the underlying
messaging middleware, depending on the implementation.
