## riff core deployer

deployers deploy a workload

### Synopsis

Deployers can be created for a build or an image. Build based deployers
continuously watch for the latest image and will deploy new images. If the
underlying build is deleted, the deployer will continue to run, but will no
longer self update. Image based deployers must be manually updated to trigger
the rollout of an updated image.

Users wishing to perform checks on built images before deploying them can
provide their own external process to watch the build for new images and only
update the deployer image once those checks pass.

The service to access the deployer is available in the deployer listing.

### Options

  -h, --help   help for deployer
